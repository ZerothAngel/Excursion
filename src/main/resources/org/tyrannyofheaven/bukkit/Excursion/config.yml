# World aliases. Each key should be a canonical world name (e.g. the name of
# the world's directory). The associated value is a list containing one or more
# aliases. Note that if the world is the primary world of a group (see below),
# the aliases will also apply to the group.

# World groups. A world group treats all members as a single location for the
# /visit command. For example, if "world" and "world_nether" are in the same
# group like so:
#
#   groups:
#     world:
#     - world_nether
#
# Then if you are in world_nether and /visit out to a different world, when you
# "/visit world" or "/visit world_nether", you will return to world_nether.
#
# All world names should be the canonical name of that world. Each key is
# the group's "primary world," which is the world where players who have
# never visited the group will spawn. The associated value should be a list
# of one or more member worlds.
#
# Note that there is no way to directly visit any of the worlds in a group
# using this plugin. Players will either teleport to their previous location
# in that group of worlds or in the primary world's spawn point. Use of portals
# or nether portals to move between worlds in a group is assumed.
